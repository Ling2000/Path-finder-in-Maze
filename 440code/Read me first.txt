Everyone contributed equally. 

We have not used anyone else's work for our project, our work is only our own and our group's.

Our project compiler：PyCharm Community Edition 2020.3.3 x64
Python version 3.9


Just in case 
I will write more comments and notes here.

for all the maze except fire predict maze

1 for good cell
0 for obstacle p
2 for fire
0.5 for the potential way
0.3 for the way we walked （strategy1, 2, 3 only）

for fire predict maze

0 for fire
-1 for obstacle and the cell that fire can never reach
from 1 to infinity is the the fastest steps that fire can reach this grid

Steps For Usage
1. run the python
2. input dimension p (Separate by blank(" "))  (and q for strategy1, 2, 3)
3. you will see the preview for the maze (graph)
4. after you Turn off preview for the maze (graph), the code will run and give you a path(graph2)  (you will see fire graph  in strategy1, 2, 3.) if u can not see the graph2 code will print something to let you know what happened. e.g no way out
5. after u turn off the final graph2. done.

"no way out" or "just a bad maze. no way out"  means bad maze  no path out 
"you reach the goal" means you reach the goal
"u have been burned" means  you  have been burned and code will print where you were burned    e.g (3,6)
"Juat a bad maze or Fire or/and obstacles are blocking you. No way out" means  bad maze  no path out   OR  The fire blocked your way, you have no way to go   (only for  strategy2, 3. )



Notes： 

Our project can run very well. We finish all the stuff. If you have any questions about a run, please print all the mazes we use 
(this may be a lot, because the three of us wrote different things)

for more comment u can see another txt    comment and notes for fire prediction.txt
I dont think you really need it...

Thank you
